/*
205. Isomorphic Strings
Easy

Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

Example 1:
Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true
Explanation:
The strings s and t can be made identical by:
    Mapping 'e' to 'a'.
    Mapping 'g' to 'd'.

Example 2:
Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false
Explanation:
The strings s and t can not be made identical as 'o' needs to be mapped to both 'a' and 'r'.

Example 3:
Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
Output: true

Constraints:
    1 <= s.length <= 5 * 1e4
    t.length == s.length
    s and t consist of any valid ascii character.
